# Framer Motion Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Framer Motion animations throughout the Grimoire application.

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Enhanced Animation Components Library
- Extended the existing animation components in `src/components/animations/index.tsx`
- Added new animation variants for more diverse motion effects
- Created specialized animation components for specific UI elements
- Added accessibility support with `useReducedMotion` hook

### 2. Page Transitions
- Created a `PageTransitionWrapper` component for the App Router
- Enhanced the existing `PageTransition` component with more options
- Implemented the page transition wrapper in the dashboard layout

### 3. UI Component Animations
- Created `AnimatedButton` component for button animations
- Created `AnimatedCard` component for card animations
- Created `AnimatedDialog` component for enhanced dialog animations
- Enhanced dashboard components with animations:
  - `DashboardHeader`
  - `StatCard`
  - `ChartCard`
  - `DataTable`

### 4. Animation Demo Page
- Created a comprehensive demo page at `/animation-demo`
- Showcases all available animations in one place
- Provides examples of how to use each animation component

### 5. Documentation
- Added a README file in the animations directory
- Documented all animation components and their usage
- Provided examples for common use cases

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Animation Presets
- Create a set of animation presets for common UI patterns
- Implement a configuration system for customizing animation parameters

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement lazy loading for animation components
- Use the `will-change` property strategically for hardware acceleration
- Add animation throttling for low-end devices

### 3. Additional Animation Types
- Add more complex animations like path animations for SVGs
- Implement scroll-driven animations for storytelling sections
- Add gesture-based animations for touch interactions

### 4. Testing
- Add unit tests for animation components
- Implement visual regression testing for animations
- Test performance impact of animations

### 5. Animation Hooks
- Create custom hooks for common animation patterns
- Implement hooks for scroll-based animations
- Create hooks for animating data visualizations

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Use the provided animation components rather than creating custom animations
2. **Accessibility**: Always consider users who prefer reduced motion
3. **Performance**: Be mindful of animation performance, especially on mobile devices
4. **Purpose**: Use animations to enhance the user experience, not distract from it
